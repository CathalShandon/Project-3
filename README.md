# Hangman

Hangman is a game for two in which one player tries to guess the letters of a word, the other player recording failed attempts by drawing a gallows and someone hanging on it, line by line.
For this project I wanted to create a version of this game that you can play against the computer rather than playing against another person.
The way this game plays will tell you how many tries you have and how many letters you have to guess.
You win by guessing the word that the computer has chosen for you in that game.

## Plans and structure 

## Features 

### Welcome page
- This is the first page you see when the app loads. On this page there is a welcome message and a question to the user. The question asks the user if they want to see the instructions or if they are happy to go ahead and play without seeing them. 

### Instructions
- The instructions page explains to the user how the game is played and then asks the user if they are ready for the game.

### Game
- When the user starts the game, it shows the user the length of the word they are guessing and asks the user to enter a letter.


- While the user is playing the game page also shows other things such as if their last guess was valid, correct, or incorrect, how many tries the user has left, what letters the user has used so far and the letters guessed correctly in their positions within the word.
